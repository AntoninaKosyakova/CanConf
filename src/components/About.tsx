              <p>
                My journey in tech began in 2022 when I attended my first hackathon. 
                That experience completely shaped who I am today and ignited my passion 
                for the tech community.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Inspired by that first hackathon, I founded my college's hackathon and 
                served as Director of Logistics for <strong>JACHacks</strong>. In 2025, 
                I had the honor of serving as President, helping to grow the event and 
                create opportunities for other students.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I was also privileged to serve as Director of Events for <strong>CUSEC</strong> 
                in 2024, and later as Co-Chair in 2025 â€” one of my proudest moments. 
                These experiences taught me the incredible impact that tech events can 
                have on students and professionals alike.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I created <strong>CanConf</strong> to help students across Canada discover 
                the same life-changing opportunities that I was fortunate to find. Every 
                hackathon, conference, and tech event has the potential to spark someone's 
                passion, just like mine was sparked back in 2022.
